  </header>
 <main>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 15, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>LiveMatch.com.ng</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our website, mobile applications, and other services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information that falls into two main categories: Personal Information (data you provide) and Non-Personal & Usage Data (data collected automatically).</p>

    <h3>1.1. Personal Information (Data You Provide)</h3>
    <p>This includes information that directly or indirectly identifies you:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>1.2. Non-Personal & Usage Data (Data Collected Automatically)</h3>
    <p>This data is collected automatically via cookies, pixels, and third-party tools:</p>

    <h2>3. Cookies, Google AdSense, and Third-Party Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance user experience, analyze website performance, and serve advertisements. Third-party vendors, including <strong>Google</strong>, use cookies to serve ads based on your previous visits to our website or other websites.</p>

    <p>Google uses the <strong>DoubleClick cookie</strong> and other tracking technologies to show personalised advertisements. This enables Google and its partners to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve interest-based ads.</li>
        <li>Measure ad performance.</li>
        <li>Limit how often ads are shown.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For users in certain jurisdictions (e.g., the EEA/UK), we rely on your **explicit consent** to place non-essential cookies (like advertising cookies) on your device, as required by the EU User Consent Policy.</p>

    <p>You may opt out of personalised advertising by visiting the following links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Personalization Settings</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">AboutAds Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may disable or manage cookies in your browser settings at any time. However, this may affect certain features on the website.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Information. Limited non-personal information may be shared with trusted third-party partners for analytics, advertising, hosting, and website optimization purposes (e.g., Google Analytics, advertising partners). These partners operate under strict confidentiality and data-protection agreements. We may also disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your information. Despite our efforts, no method of data transmission or online storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection. We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights including the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your Personal Information, and the right to object to or restrict processing. You also have the right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</p>

    <h2>7. External Links</h2>
    <p>Our website may contain links to external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of external sites. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites visited.</p>
